		// Normally we work with transparent pictures, because it looks really cool.  But
		//   when we print, transparent pictures turn out black.  So we need them to be
		//   non-transparent.  The only way I've found to do this procedurally is to copy
		//   them to the clipboard, then get them back out of the clipboard.  It's weird,
		//   but it works.
		// â—ŠCal_NextObjectNum was set to the number of pictures +1 when we called
		//   Calendar_PlaceEvents.  It's a little questionable to assume the value is
		//   still valid, but it's much faster than doing another search, so we'll use it.
		//   But you might break it if you change how events are placed.
