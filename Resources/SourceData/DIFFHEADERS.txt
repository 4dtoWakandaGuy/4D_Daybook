//@NOTES
OK so in this document you can store your required headers. You will see there are headers for methods, scripts, triggers and form methods.
on each one after the header there are identifiers-as labels
note in the header the use of some variables. Not the seperators bounded by values starting with a at-symbol and ending with an at-symbol -obviously dont use those values in your text or
you will confuse the code picking this up
Note this a text document rather than an xml document because generally putting this text together is easier than putting into xml.
$_t_HeaderMethodName-this will be replaced with the method name
Current date and time will be replaced with the current date and time
<>DIFF_t_CurrentDesigner gets replaced with the current designer-when you start the system asks who you are(there is a method to auto set it)
$_t_DesignerName is the same value unless its an existing method with no header-bit unfair to declare it was written by the current programmer
other vars in the template are what i use in my code-and are put in the header as is
